The Map scritpures app allows you to navigate to any chapter in the cannon, and then functionality varies depending on the device. 
In a non-plus device, you need to select the place to show the map. I got negative feedback on having a button to show the map,
and decided this was the better way. 

The app meets the specs, builds without warnings, and works great. 

The UI feedback was all that it works great, but not to have the map button when in portrait mode (or at all on a smaller than
plus device).
